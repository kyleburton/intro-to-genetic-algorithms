h1. Introduction to Genetic Algorithms

This is a potential talk that I offered to Philly Lambda.

* complex problem spaces
* getting stuck in local maximas
** effect of mutation probability and rate on the chances you'll escape a local maxima
* GA is a stochiastic process
** it may not _ever_ find a solution
** your problem may not have a solution(!)
** it may take a really long time
** ...leads to talking about the aplicabilty of GA to different types of problems
** it may not be the best approach
* What kinds of problems is it good for then?
* choosing a representation for your genome
* breeding
* random mutation
** mutation probability
** mutation rate
** swapping
* The fitness function
** between 0 and 1
** the effect of squaring it
* 'Dead' chromosomes
** can carry information
